                    This project is a small damon based WAN-failOver which allso serves as a router
                    <br>
                    it is currently tested only on the raspberry pi 4 B+
                    <br>
                    it uses raspbian buster in 64 bit
                    <br>
                    i do not think it will work on 32 bit versions
                    <br>
                    it shoud work on other versions of the raspberry pi but is not tested yet
